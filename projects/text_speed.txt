Personaly I think that the data leaks by twitter can potenially lead to ususpecting attacks on my twiter email which contains very sensitive information including, saved passwords of websites I casually access for payments.
As a freelancer, I can be subject to the loss of freelancing job accounts, this leave me jobless and could mean a major set back in my carrer. 
As a freelancer I do my exams online, the exams in some of the websites are only linked to that particular email.
A loss of the Email would mean loss of certificates if they were not backed up to anoother safe storage platform.
